Also known as the twat blocker, a tampermonkey script that blocks annoying trolls on Lowyat.net forum <br>
<br>
Ever been pestered by annoying trolls on lowyat net forum? The ban list built in on lowyat net merely stops others from private messaging 
you but does not stop them from flaming and harassing you.

<br><br>

Example : look at this guy, he doesnt know how to play nice with others.He is always finding ways to rile up everyone. Thats fine. 
We want to enjoy a nice discussion when we go on the internet and we do not need to put up with his rudeness.

<br><br>

<img src = "bacometer2.png"></br>
<img src = "bacometer3.png"></br>

<br>

So what we gonna do is we gonna put his user name in an array called blockedlist.

<img src = "bacometer4.png>
            
            <br>
            
Make sure the tampermonkey is enabled

<img src = "bacometer5.png>
            
            <br>
            
  and Taaadaa...... his post will never be seen again , and post quoting his post will also be missing
  
  <img src = "bacometer6.png">
